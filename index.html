					<h2>Project Overview</h2>
					<p>This project aims to help beginners with their first contributions.</p>
                    <p>It supports both technical and non-technical contributions! It allows contributors to translate languages from english to spanish, french, russian, etc.</p>
                    <p>People who use it are beginners and those who may need a language translation in order to be able to understand what is going on.</p>

					<h2>Contribution Guidelines</h2>
					<p>The guidelines are found in the contributing file.</p>
					<p>If listed guidelines aren't being followed, you may be banned from the repository and your pr can be marked as invalid.</p>
					<p>The onboarding process is beginner friendly as this is who this repository is mainly targeted for.</p>
		            <p>You have to be a beginner if you are making the contributions and only two contributions are allowed per person. Nothing really confused me about this because it is a repository meant for beginners. </p>
